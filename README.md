# In-browser markdown-editor

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/inbrowser-markdown-editor-r16TrrQX9).

## Overview

The challenge was to build out this in-browser markdown editor and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users can:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete markdown documents
- Name and save documents to be accessed as needed
- Edit the markdown of a document and see the formatted preview of the content
- View a full-page preview of the formatted content
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Switch to dark mode
- This project utilizes localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed

## Tech stack

- [ViteJs](vitejs.dev) - A build tool for a faster development experience
- [ReactJS](reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) - A markdown component for React
